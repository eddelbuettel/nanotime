### Motivation

R has excellent tools for dates and times. The `Date` and `POSIXct` classes (as well as the 'wide'
representation in `POSIXlt`) are versatile, and a lot of useful tooling has been built around them.

However, `POSIXct` is implemented as a `double` with fractional seconds since the epoch. Given the
53 bits accuracy, it leaves just a bit less than _microsecond_ resolution. Furthermore, using
floating-point arithmetic for an integer concept opens the door to painful issues of error
accumulation.

More and more performance measurements, latency statistics, etc., are now measured more finely, and we
need _nanosecond_ resolution for which commonly an `integer64` is used to represent nanoseconds
since the epoch.

And while R does not have a _native_ type for this, the [bit64](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bit64)
package by [Jens Oehlschlägel](https://github.com/joehl) offers a performant one implemented as a
lightweight S3 class. So this package uses the `integer64` class, along with multiple helper functions
for parsing and formatting at nano-second resolution from the [RcppCCTZ](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.cctz.html)
package which wraps the [CCTZ library](https://github.com/google/cctz) from Google. CCTZ is a modern C++11 library
extending the (C++11-native) `chrono` type.

In addition to the point-in-time type `nanotime`, this package also provides an interval type
`nanoival` which may have open or closed start/end, a period type `nanoperiod` that is a human
representation of time, such as day, month, etc., and a duration type `nanoduration`. These types
are similar to what the [lubridate](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate) package proposes.

Set and arithmetic operations on these types are available. All functionality is designed to
correctly handle instances across different time zones. Because these temporal types are based on R
built-in types, most functions have an efficient implementation and the types are suitable for use
in `data.frame` and `data.table`. `nanotime` is also a better choice than the native `POSIXct` in
most of the cases where fractional seconds are needed because it avoids floating point issues.

### Demo

See the included demo script [nanosecondDelayExample.R](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/nanotime/blob/master/demo/nanosecondDelayExample.R)
for a (completely simulated and hence made-up) study of network latency measured
in nanoseconds resulting in the figure below

### Examples

#### Simple Parsing and Arithmetic

```r
R> x <- as.nanotime("1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000001+00:00")
R> x
[1] "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000001+00:00"
R> x + 1e9
[1] "1970-01-01T00:00:01.000000001+00:00"
R> as.nanotime("2020-03-21 Europe/London")
[1] 2020-03-21T00:00:00+00:00
```

#### Vectorised

```r
R> options("width"=60)
R> v <- nanotime(Sys.time()) + 1:5
R> v
[1] 2020-03-22T03:09:20.732122001+00:00
[2] 2020-03-22T03:09:20.732122002+00:00
[3] 2020-03-22T03:09:20.732122003+00:00
[4] 2020-03-22T03:09:20.732122004+00:00
[5] 2020-03-22T03:09:20.732122005+00:00
R>
```

#### Use with `zoo`

```r
R> library(zoo)
R> z <- zoo(cbind(A=1:5, B=5:1), v)
R> options(nanotimeFormat="%H:%M:%E*S")  ## override default format
R> z
R> options(nanotimeFormat=NULL)  ## go back to default format
R> z
```

#### Use with data.table

```r
R> library(data.table)
R> dt <- data.table(v, cbind(A=1:5, B=5:1))
R> fwrite(dt, file="datatableTest.csv")  # write out
R> dtcheck <- fread("datatableTest.csv") # read back
R> dtcheck
R> dtcheck[, v:=nanotime(v)]             # read as a string, need to re-class as nanotime
R> fread("../datatableTest.csv", colClasses=c("nanotime", "integer", "integer"))
```

#### Use with data.frame

This requires version 0.0.2 or later.

```r
R> data.frame(cbind(A=1:5, B=5:1), v=v)
```

#### Intervals

```r
R> ival <- as.nanoival("+2009-01-01 13:12:00 America/New_York -> 2009-02-01 15:11:03 America/New_York-")
R> ival
[1] +2009-01-01T18:12:00+00:00 -> 2009-02-01T20:11:03+00:00-

R> start <- nanotime("2009-01-01 13:12:00 America/New_York")
R> end   <- nanotime("2009-02-01 15:11:00 America/New_York")
R> nanoival(start, end)                   # by default sopen=F,eopen=T
[1] +2009-01-01T18:12:00+00:00 -> 2009-02-01T20:11:00+00:00-
R> nanoival(start, end, sopen=FALSE, eopen=TRUE)
[1] +2009-01-01T18:12:00+00:00 -> 2009-02-01T20:11:00+00:00-

R> intersect(as.nanoival("+2019-03-01 UTC -> 2020-03-01 UTC-"),
             as.nanoival("+2020-01-01 UTC -> 2020-06-01 UTC-"))
[1] +2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2020-03-01T00:00:00+00:00-

R> union(as.nanoival("+2019-03-01 UTC -> 2020-03-01 UTC-"),
         as.nanoival("+2020-01-01 UTC -> 2020-06-01 UTC-"))
[1] +2019-03-01T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2020-06-01T00:00:00+00:00-

R> setdiff(as.nanoival("+2019-03-01 UTC -> 2020-03-01 UTC-"),
           as.nanoival("+2020-01-01 UTC -> 2020-06-01 UTC-"))
[1] +2019-03-01T00:00:00+00:00 -> 2020-01-01T00:00:00+00:00-    
```

### Technical Details

The [bit64](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bit64) package (by [Jens
Oehlschlägel](https://github.com/joehl)) supplies the `integer64` type used to store the nanosecond
resolution time as (positive or negative) offsets to the epoch of January 1, 1970. The
[RcppCCTZ](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.cctz.html) package supplies the formatting and
parsing routines based on the (modern C++) library [CCTZ](https://github.com/google/cctz) from
Google, when the parsing cannot be done using a fast built-in parser. `integer64` is also used for
the type `nanoduration`, whereas `nanoival` and `nanoperiod` are stored in a `complex`, i.e. over
128 bits.

### Status

The package is by now fairly mature, has been rewritten once (to go from S3
to S4) and has recently received a sizeable feature extension. There may
still be changes, though there should generally never be breaking ones. The
package also has an extensive test suite, and very good code coverage.

See the [issue tickets](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/nanotime/issues) for an up to date list of
potentially desirable, possibly planned, or at least discussed items.

### Installation

The package is on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and can be installed via a standard

```r
install.packages("nanotime")
```

whereas in order to install development versions a

```r
remotes::install_github("eddelbuettel/nanotime")  # dev version
```

should suffice.
